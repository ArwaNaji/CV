          I used to be part of a reading club where we had to pick a book and discuss it. The club is not active now, but I still enjoy reading a good book. I also enjoy releasing my thoughts through writing.
          <br>
          I also enjoy to push myself out of my comfort zone and try to engage in new roles and try new things. I enjoy being part of thoughtful conversation with friends and anyone who can spark a new idea in my head.
